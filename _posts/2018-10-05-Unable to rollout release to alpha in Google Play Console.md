You are required to supply information in the sections marked with a grey checkmark (now a grey triangle with exclamation mark), in all required fields (marked with a blue asterisk). This includes, but isn't restricted to:

Pricing and Distribution:

setting app availability to all countries (don't worry about this, read on),
configuring presence of ads and being targeted primarily at children,
confirming Android Content Guidelines compliance,
acknowledging the app being subject to US export laws,
configuring testing (you can have a closed alpha, hence countries doesn't matter at this stage)
Store listing:

uploading feature graphics and even screenshots, yeah...
A bit like this.

Once that's done, you'll get two "Ready to publish" labels, at the top of the page, the right one being a link to the App Releases management section where you can complete your rollout.
