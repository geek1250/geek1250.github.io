<p>
Although there ia an article saying if the email is not an Apple Id, once you get the invitation link like https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/activation_ds?key=**************, apple will ask you to create account.
However,it is wrong.There is no response. So it is neccesaty to create an account first.
